> # Smith Chart Example

This example demonstrates the use of a Smith Chart for impedance matching:

## Problem:
Match a load of Z_L = 100 + j50 Ω to a 50 Ω transmission line.

## Steps:
1. Normalize the load impedance: \( z = \frac{Z_L}{Z_0} = \frac{100 + j50}{50} = 2 + j1 \)
2. Plot the normalized impedance on the Smith Chart.
3. Move toward the generator using transmission line segments or match using a stub.
4. Read the required length and stub position.
